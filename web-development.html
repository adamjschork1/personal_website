  <p>My journey to becoming a developer has been several years in the making. Over time I've been learning code and writing web pages as a hobby. As my career in digital marketing progressed, my interests and professional work began to merge. Improving web pages' SEO meant actively editing HTML, writing structured data markup, improving speed with code placement and asyncronous loading, and much more. Editing a document didn't end with optimizing it though - my hobby of coding was soon put into professional practice as requests came in to edit existing pages, changing style and function, as well as build new pages. In 2020 I started to enter the role of a dev as a website manager, and while I spent two thirds of my time in digital marketing, data analysis and strategy, I found myself picking up dev projects with my remaining time.</p>

    <p>I've lumped HTML and CSS together here becasue these aren't coding languages and also because knowing HTML is not an impressive skill. CSS on the other hand is the part that takes a lot of hand on experience. This is becasue the number of possible ways a web page can be styled are nearly limitless, and while HTML has not changed a lot over the years, CSS has actually changed quite a bit (and still is). Having a fairly good comprehension of how to style a page is a must, but as one dives into all of the fancy and newer features, it's important to code for compatability for multiple browsers and devices.</p>
    
    <p>My approach to building a page is fluid, strategic and proactive. My goal is to write in the most efficeint way possible to reduce going back to prior code to clean it up or modify it. Whether I start building out a mobile version first or for desktop, I always keep in mind how one will look compared to the other, where to make breakpoints and how many to make. With so many devices and screen sizes these days, I don't follow a rigid screen breakpoint rule. My approach is not to design for specific devices, but to rearrange a page's content and design where it makes sence, organicly.</p>
    
    <p>I have familiarity with various CSS libraries, including Bootstrap, Pure and SASS (although SASS is actually a scripting language). When it comes to a new library, I can research its naming conventions and adapt fairly quickly. I generally try to avoid importing and using libraries unless there are project time restrictions or preexisting use, in which case keeping the website cohesive neccesitates it. I have some experience with jquery, though I try to avoid jquery dependency.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, trying to be as objective as possible, I give myself a three out of five stars in this category. I created this rating comparing myself to a spectrum of skill level, starting from zero knowledge and going up to a ten year seasoned pro. I've been doing this for several years, and based on my expereince, I am comfortable and confident in this category.</p>

    <p>I have to start this section off by saying that I love programming. I've always been obsessed with knowing how everything works. Electronics, cars, construction, martial arts, language, space travel, dark matter, black holes, history, data science, biology, astrophysics - you name it, I've probably learned about it. My thirst for knowing the universe around me has no bounds. For me, programming is something I want to continue to learn and do on a weekly basis.</p>
    
    <p>Most of my javascript experience is with good old vanilla. My on the job experience with this is primarily editing existing code, not with writing new functionality. Since JavaScript is my current primary scripting language focus, I'm able to get in and change code without breaking it. A common problem some have when learning Python first and JavaScript later, is that the syntactic requirements can be difficult to quickly internalize and consistently use. Knowing when to use brackets and semicolons is vital. Going beyond just the basics though, having a general good grasp on how one function can work with another, how they can conflict, and writing clean code are all important aspects of good developer practices. Naming conventions and notes are other considerations I take and be sure to make everything clear so that another developer can more easily come in and make changes.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, my familiarity with this language is fairly comprehensive. In addition to books and other courses on the subject, I have taken Free Code Camp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course, representing about 300 hours of work. This includes the basics, ES6, regular expressions, debugging, basic data structures, basic and intermediate algorithm scripting, object oriented programming and functional programming. I also complete challenges on Codewars. I give myself 2 out of 5 stars, not because I'm bad at the language, but because I don't have as much professional hands on experience with this as I'd like.</p>

    <p>Liquid is a language created by and used on Shopify. For those not in ecomm, Shopify is a widely used e-comm platform for online retailers. Shopify is built with the Ruby on Rails framework. Shopify's github describes Liquid as such: "Liquid is an open-source template language created by Shopify and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts."</p>
    
    <p>Liquid is very easy to use, similar to HTML, but does have its own unique features. Since it is a template language, learning it is not difficult at all. I've been working with Liquid for over a year now, and haven't made any mistakes with it yet. This includes dynamically loading content and writing conditional functions. I give myself a three out of five. With another year of experience I will probably add another star to my self rating.</p>

      <h2>Website Portfolio</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Over the years I've worked on a lot of different websites using various platforms. It started back in 2010 when creating a website became a necessity for a small business I was running. Since then my ability has far surpassed using a website builder to drag and drop elements to create very basic designs. Fast forward to today, and I've worked on roughly 60 websites, and can hand code an entire website without any templates or libraries (as I have this one). The following websites I've been involved in to various degrees, at a minimum modifying page code and making adjustments, both stylistic and functional.</p>
